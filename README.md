# Keras Applications
Keras Applications are deep learning models that are made available alongside pre-trained weights. These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning.

Weights are downloaded automatically when instantiating a model. They are stored at ~/.keras/models/.

Upon instantiation, the models will be built according to the image data format set in your Keras configuration file at ~/.keras/keras.json. For instance, if you have set image_data_format=channels_last, then any model loaded from this repository will get built according to the TensorFlow data format convention, "Height-Width-Depth".
